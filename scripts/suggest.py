"""Publish a creative suggestion. What the pipeline runs after it imports.

    python scripts/suggest.py                    # every brand with an account
    python scripts/suggest.py --brand renegade   # just one
    python scripts/suggest.py --dry-run          # build the pack, ask nobody
    python scripts/suggest.py --force            # republish today's

WHY THIS IS NOT A BUTTON

It was one, for about an hour. A suggestion somebody has to remember to ask for
is a suggestion nobody asks for -- which is the same failure the scheduled pull
exists to fix, one layer up: before `scripts/sync.py` the staleness window was
not 24 hours, it was "whenever anyone remembered". A button on a page is that
sentence again, wearing a nicer hat.

So the answer is written when the numbers change, not when somebody thinks to
ask, and it is already on the page when the page is opened.

WHY A FILE AND NOT A TABLE

`scripts/brief.py` makes this argument first and it holds here: a live page
silently rewrites its own past opinion every time Meta restates, so the only
way to ask "what did it say last week, and what did it say it against" is to
have kept a copy. The pack that produced each suggestion is stored beside it.

It also needs no migration. `ads_migrate.py --apply` is denied, this database is
shared, and a feature that cannot ship without a person running DDL is a feature
that does not ship this week.

ONE FILE PER BRAND PER DAY. Re-running replaces today's rather than appending:
a second import on the same afternoon should improve the suggestion, not leave
two of them and no way to tell which the page will show. `--force` is only
needed to overwrite a file that is already there; the scheduler passes it,
because the second pull of the day is exactly the case that should update.

Exit codes, for n8n to branch on:
    0  published
    1  something failed -- read logs/suggest.log
    2  a run was already in progress
    3  nothing to publish for (no active account, or no ads spent)
